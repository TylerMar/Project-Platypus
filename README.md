Team Project-Platypus
A system is only as secure as its weakest component.  Layers of security and utilization of various families of vulnerability mitigations help to augment the overall system security.  However, mitigations typically cost money and time.  Businesses often undertake a cost-benefit analysis to weigh whether mitigation is worth the cost. Usually, the cost-benefit report does not factor metrics on capital previously spent to mitigate vulnerabilities for a specific machine or part of the system.
A software tool could automate the task of tracking vulnerability assessment findings, security-relevant test data, and reports of incidents over time.  The software should highlight hotspots on the system and predict areas for future maintenance or mitigations.  Having this data would allow a business to balance whether it is more long-term cost-effective to update a piece of software to a new major, modify the architecture, or replace some hardware or software over continuously patching or, otherwise, maintaining a specific machine.
